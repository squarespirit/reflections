Using diff to find bugs:
Compare your edited, newer version of the file to the working, older version of the file. The differences are responsible for the program working or not.

Using history for efficiency:
If you had something in an older version that you need in a newer version but deleted, with version control it is easy to locate older versions and get the code you need.

Manual commits:
Ensures that all commits are logical and purposeful

Multi-file commits:
Some version control systems are geared directly for code and programming, so allow saving multiple files in a single commit.

Viewing history with git:
Log displays a list of recent commits with their comments.
Diff allows you to compare two commits for differences.

Confidence to make changes:
If you make a change that may introduce some bugs, that is ok because you have easy access to previous versions which have no bugs.

How do I want to use Git?
To keep better track of programming projects, whether it is web or mobile development.
