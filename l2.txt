Initializing a repository:
This creates a new repository in the current directory, including a .git folder. No commits are made yet.

Staging area:
Files in the working directory may be added to the staging area. In a commit, all files in the staging area are committed to the repository. The staging area allows you to choose exactly which files in the working directory should or should not be part of the repository.

Commit size:
Use git diff to compare your current changes with the staging area, which still contains the previous commits. If files have already been placed on the staging area, use git diff --staged to compare the staging area to the most recent commits. Either way, make sure the differences (your changes) only represent one logical change.
